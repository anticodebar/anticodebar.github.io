# Why is CodeBar a Raci-Sexism activity
Racism, Sexism, That is codebar.io

Raci-Sexism is a discriminate activity against specific gender in specific race which based on racism and sexism.
It appears like forbidden specific gender in one race participate in an activity, others are not limited.
For example: Forbidden Chinese male take part in activity X.

In November 2018, there is a topic on Chinese technical community v2ex.com, which content is:
“Recently I established a free coding study group with some foreign female programmer which named ‘Codebar Shanghai’. Our activity face to female and LGBTQ group, in addition, other non-mainstream ethnicity group (We made this rule because this is an international organisation, there are many foreigners).”

In the topic, the author not only welcome female and LGBTQ group, but also allow other ethnics attend, and emphasize ‘other ethnics’ means foreigners.
Thus, the only group forbidden by the organiser is Chinese male, it is exactily a Raci-Sexism activity.
